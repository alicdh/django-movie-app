Final Proposal Overview:
I acheived displaying the movies to the web page and alphabetizing them. I also acheived linking Genres, Actors, and 
Years to the movies to let the user see what fields the movies included. A lot of things differ than what I originally 
proposed. I thought I could filter the movies by genre, year, and actor. I also thought that I could let the user 
create their own movie objects and leave comments about movies already posted to the webpage. But as it turns out, 
all of that is much more difficult to figure out than I imagined. I mostly incorporated code from my existing Django
Polls app. The rest of the code I either came up with on my own or found at the previously mentioned sites. This 
project is different from the Django Polls App in that it has more fields in the Model and the code it takes to 
implement the fields is different. I familiarized myself with the Django framework, I understand how the pieces work 
together much better than before. I also learned a lot about debugging Django/Python. I learned why migrations are 
so important and I learned how to use the console in c9 a little better. I'm disappointed that I didn't acheive as 
much as I had hoped, but I'm grateful for the learning opportunity I had to familiarize myself with Django.
